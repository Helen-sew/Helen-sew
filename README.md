- ðŸ‘‹Hi there! I am a beginner data analyst who is passionate about exploring and analyzing data to uncover insights and solve problems. I am currently learning various tools and techniques in data analysis, including SQL, Python, and data visualization tools such as Tableau.

On my GitHub profile, I am excited to share some of my projects where I have applied my newfound skills in data analysis. While I am still a beginner, I am eager to continue learning and growing in this field.

I would love to connect with other data analysts and enthusiasts to share ideas and collaborate on projects. Please feel free to explore my projects and reach out to me if you have any questions or opportunities for collaboration.
